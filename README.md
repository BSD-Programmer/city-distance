```

For production use, get your own free API key from [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/) and replace it in the HTML file.

## How to Use
1. **Enter City Name**: Type the name of your starting city
2. **Select State**: Choose the state from the dropdown
3. **Set Filters** (optional):
   - Minimum Population: Filter out smaller towns
   - Maximum Distance: Limit search radius (1-500 miles)
4. **Click "Find Nearby Cities"**: Get results with distances and driving times

## Technical Details

### Distance Calculation
Uses the Haversine formula for calculating great-circle distances:
```javascript
R = 3959 miles (Earth's radius)
distance = R * 2 * arcsin(‚àö(a))
where a = sin¬≤(Œîlat/2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin¬≤(Œîlon/2)
```

### Driving Time API
Integrates with OpenRouteService for real driving directions:
```
GET https://api.openrouteservice.org/v2/directions/driving-car
```

### Data Format
CSV structure:
```
name,state_code,state_name,county,lat,lon,population,feature_type
Dallas,TX,Texas,Dallas County,32.996848,-96.792113,1343573,Populated Place
```

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+

## Performance Notes
- Database loads in ~1-2 seconds on typical connections
